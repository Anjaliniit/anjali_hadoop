In planning Project, there are total modules:
1. No of Senior citizen after x year's.
2. No of Voter's  after x year's.
3. No of Male and No of Female.
4. No of citizen and no of immigrants of employment.

We have two file one is sample.dat and other is agegroup.txt. The sample.dat file is in json format
so that first we convert that file into csv format using hive.

HOW TO CONVERT sample.dat File into CSV FORMAT:

1. store ur file on linux env(like /home/cloudera/Desktop)
    by drag and drop using winscp server

2. copy ur file on hadoop root 
    hadoop fs put /home/cloudera/Desktop/Project/sample.dat /user/cloudera/

3. create one table to store json file i.e. sample.dat as a single column.

create table censusdata(jsondata string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

4.  load data inpath '/home/cloudera/Desktop/Project/sample.dat' into table censusdata;

NOTE: step 2 and 4 combine by one step there is a local keyword i.e. used with load command that first load the data to the hadoop then your table.

load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/Desktop/Project/sample.dat' into table censusdata;
Note:
when we move data to our table then your txt or dat or json file is not available on hadoop location

5. now create one another table according to ur requirement what data you would like to fetch from json sample.dat file

create table census(age int,education string,maritalstatus string,gender string,taxfilerstatus string, income double,Parents string,
countryofbirth string,citizenship string,weeksworked string)
row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;
NOTE:
In hive by default fields terminated is comma i.e.  ,

6. now load data into our table from table that contains json data as a single column
insert overwrite table census
select get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Age'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Education'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.MaritalStatus'),
get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Gender'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.TaxFilerStatus'),
get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Income'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Parents'),
get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.CountryOfBirth'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.Citizenship'),get_json_object(censusdata.jsondata,'$.WeeksWorked')
from censusdata;
