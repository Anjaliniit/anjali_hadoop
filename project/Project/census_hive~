census one query---------------

1. store ur file on linux env(like /home/cloudera/Desktop)
    by drag and drop using winscp server

2. copy ur file on hadoop root 
    hadoop fs put /home/cloudera/Desktop/agegroup.dat /
    hadoop fs put /home/cloudera/Desktop/agegroup.dat /

3. create one table 

create table agegroup(age int,type string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

4.  load data inpath '/agegroup.dat' into table agegroup

NOTE: step 2 and 4 combine by one step there is a local keyword i.e. used with load command that first load the data to the hadoop then your table.
    load data local inpath '/agegroup.dat' into table agegroup

when we move data to our table then your txt or dat or json file is not available on hadoop location

5. sample.dat is json file for this we have to sperate data with hive predefined function.
   create one another table to store sample.dat data by the deliminater that is not present in   the sample.dat file.
create table census_data(jsondata string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

6.  load data local inpath '/sample.dat' into table census_data

7. now create one another table according to ur requirement what data you would like to fetch from json sample.dat file

create table census_data1(age int,income double)
row format delimited
stored as textfile;

NOTE:
In hive by default fields terminated is comma i.e.  ,

8. now load data into our table from table that contains json data as a single column
insert overwrite table census_data1
select get_json_object(census_data.jsondata,'$.Age'),get_json_object(census_data.jsondata,'$.Income')
from census_data;

9  final query to fetch data

select a.type,avg(c.income) from agegroup a join census_data1 c on a.age=c.age group by a.type;    


census second query---------------

1. store ur file on linux env(like /home/cloudera/Desktop)
    by drag and drop using winscp server

2. copy ur file on hadoop root 
    hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/Desktop/sample.dat /

3. create one table 

create table agegroup(age int,type string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

4.  load data inpath '/agegroup.dat' into table agegroup

NOTE: step 2 and 4 combine by one step there is a local keyword i.e. used with load command that first load the data to the hadoop then your table.
    load data local inpath '/agegroup.dat' into table agegroup

5. sample.dat is json file for this we have to sperate data with hive predefined function.
   create one another table to store sample.dat data by the deliminater that is not present in   the sample.dat file.
create table census_data(jsondata string)
row format delimited fields terminated '\t'
stored as textfile;

6.  load data local inpath '/sample.dat' into table census_data

7. now create one another table according to ur requirement what data you would like to fetch from json sample.dat file

create table census_data2(age int,gender string)
row format delimited
stored as textfile;

NOTE:In hive by default fields terminated is comma i.e.  ,

8. now load data into our table from table that contains json data as a single column
insert overwrite table census_data2
select get_json_object(census_data.jsondata,'$.Age'),get_json_object(census_data.jsondata,'$.gender')
from census_data;

9. final query to fetch data
select a.type,100*(sum(case when c.gender=' Male' then 1 else 0 end)/sum(case when c.gender=' Female' then 1 else 0 end) ) as ratio from census_data2 c join agegroup a on a.age=c.age  group by a.type;
